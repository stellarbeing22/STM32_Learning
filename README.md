# STM32 Nucleo Basic Projects

This repository contains my beginner projects for STM32 Nucleo boards, created while learning embedded systems development.  
All projects are built using **STM32CubeIDE** and are kept simple and beginner-friendly.

## Projects

- **LED Blink**  
  Basic GPIO output example. Turns an LED on and off with a delay.

- **Button Polling**  
  Demonstrates reading input from a push button using polling.

- **LCD Parallel 8 bit**  
  Interfacing a 2004 LCD with the STM32 via the parallel 8-bit mode.

- **ADC**  
  Reading analog input values and displaying them via USART2.

- **Timers & PWM**  
  Using hardware timers to generate PWM signals.

- STM32 Nucleo Development Board (e.g., Nucleo-F103RB)  
- USB cable for programming and power  
- Basic peripherals like LEDs, buttons, and an I2C LCD (for relevant projects)
